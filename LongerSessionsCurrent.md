Based on the documentation and our current implementation, here are the key strategies to achieve longer login sessions with `@atproto/oauth-client-browser@0.3.23`:

## **ðŸŽ¯ Key Strategies for Longer Sessions:**

### **1. Use Production Client Metadata (Not Loopback)**
The documentation clearly states that loopback clients have **very limited refresh token validity (typically 1 day)**. Our current dev setup uses loopback metadata.

**Solution:** Ensure production uses proper client metadata with longer token lifetimes.

### **2. Leverage Automatic Token Refresh**
The new OAuth client automatically handles token refresh transparently:

```typescript
// From the docs: "If the current access_token is expired, the session will automatically
// (and transparently) refresh it. The new token set will be saved through the client's session store."
```

### **3. Use Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Pattern**
The documentation recommends using `@atproto/oauth-client-node` with a backend server for longer-lived tokens:

> "When a backend server is available, it is recommended to use `@atproto/oauth-client-node` to manage OAuth sessions from the server side... Thanks to the added security, the OAuth server will provide longer lived tokens when issued to a BFF (Backend-for-frontend)."

## **ðŸš€ Implementation Plan:**

### **Phase 1: Optimize Current Browser Implementation**

I notice we only have `oauth-client-native.json` but not a regular `oauth-client.json` for web browsers. Let me check what our current production setup looks like:

Now I can see the issue! Let me create the missing production client metadata file and implement the strategies for longer sessions:

## **ðŸš€ Implementation Plan for Longer Sessions:**

### **Step 1: Create Production Client Metadata**

### **Step 2: Enhance Session Management for Better Token Refresh**

### **Step 3: Add Session Health Monitoring**

## **ðŸŽ¯ Summary: Longer Session Implementation**

### **âœ… What We've Implemented:**

1. **Production Client Metadata (`oauth-client.json`):**
   - Created proper production client metadata for web browsers
   - This enables longer token lifetimes compared to loopback clients
   - Uses `application_type: "web"` for proper OAuth server recognition

2. **Enhanced Token Refresh Handling:**
   - Updated `onSessionUpdated` handler to properly refresh the agent when tokens are updated
   - Ensures seamless token refresh without user interruption

3. **Session Health Monitoring:**
   - Added `checkSessionHealth()` to test session validity
   - Added `getSessionInfo()` for debugging and monitoring
   - Helps identify when sessions are failing

### **ðŸš€ Expected Improvements:**

1. **Longer Token Lifetimes:** Production client metadata should receive longer refresh tokens from OAuth servers
2. **Seamless Token Refresh:** Automatic token refresh handled transparently by the OAuth client
3. **Better Session Monitoring:** Ability to detect and handle session issues proactively

### **ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Maximum Session Length:**

1. **Consider BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern:** For even longer sessions, implement a backend server using `@atproto/oauth-client-node`
2. **Session Persistence:** Ensure sessions are properly persisted in the browser's IndexedDB (handled by the OAuth client)
3. **User Feedback:** Add UI to show session status and when sessions will expire

**The current implementation should significantly improve session length compared to the previous loopback-only setup!** ðŸŽ‰

Would you like me to implement any additional features like session status UI or handle autofill?
