Yes, having your own AT Protocol Personal Data Server (PDS) at [https://pds.roomy.space/](https://pds.roomy.space/) is a **major advantage** for implementing the AIP Proxy approach with extended session management. Here’s why and how:

---

## **How Your Own PDS Helps with Extended Session Management**

### **1. Full Control Over Session Policies**
- **With your own PDS,** you can modify or extend the session expiration and refresh logic at the server level, rather than being limited by the default Bluesky PDS or third-party providers.
- You can implement custom endpoints or hooks to support longer session lifetimes and custom activity windows (e.g., 2 years max, 3 months inactivity).

### **2. Seamless Integration with AIP Proxy (BFF Pattern)**
- The AIP Proxy (Backend-for-Frontend) pattern works by having your frontend talk to a backend proxy, which then talks to the PDS.
- **With your own PDS,** your proxy can:
  - Manage its own session store (e.g., Redis, database) with custom expiration/activity logic.
  - Use the PDS’s `/xrpc/` endpoints to refresh or validate sessions as needed.
  - Issue and manage JWTs or cookies for your frontend, decoupled from the PDS’s default session limits.

### **3. DPoP and OAuth Customization**
- You can configure your PDS and proxy to support DPoP (Demonstration of Proof-of-Possession) and custom OAuth flows, as described in the AIP Proxy pattern.
- This allows you to securely store long-lived refresh tokens or session secrets on your proxy, and only issue short-lived access tokens to the frontend.

### **4. Self-Hosting = No Vendor Lock-In**
- You are not limited by the session policies of Bluesky or other hosted PDS providers.
- You can patch or extend the PDS codebase ([GitHub: bluesky-social/pds](https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds)) to add custom session endpoints or hooks if needed.

---

## **How to Use Your PDS with AIP Proxy**

### **A. Proxy Session Management**
- The proxy (AIP BFF) issues its own session tokens (JWT/cookie) to the frontend.
- It stores the actual ATProto session (from your PDS) in a secure backend store, with your desired expiration/activity policy.
- On each frontend request, the proxy:
  1. Validates its own session token.
  2. Checks/refreshes the ATProto session with your PDS if needed.
  3. Proxies the request to `/xrpc/` endpoints on your PDS.

### **B. Custom Session Expiry**
- The proxy can enforce a 2-year max session and 3-month inactivity window, regardless of the PDS’s built-in limits.
- If the PDS session expires, the proxy can transparently re-authenticate or prompt the user as needed.

### **C. Example Flow**
1. **User logs in** via your proxy, which authenticates with your PDS.
2. **Proxy stores** the ATProto session and issues its own long-lived session token to the frontend.
3. **Frontend makes API calls** via the proxy, which:
   - Updates the last-activity timestamp.
   - Refreshes the PDS session if needed.
   - Proxies the call to `/xrpc/` on your PDS.
4. **If 3 months pass with no activity,** the proxy expires the session and requires re-login.

**Conclusion:**  
**Yes, your own PDS is the ideal foundation for implementing the AIP Proxy approach with extended session management.** You have the flexibility to enforce your own session policies, integrate with your proxy, and provide a seamless, long-lived login experience for your users.

Absolutely! Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to implementing the AIP Proxy (Backend-for-Frontend) approach with extended session management, leveraging your own AT Protocol PDS at [https://pds.roomy.space/](https://pds.roomy.space/):

---

## **Step 1: Set Up Your BFF (AIP Proxy) Server**

**Goal:** Create a backend server that will:
- Handle OAuth with your PDS
- Store and manage extended sessions
- Proxy all ATProto XRPC calls from your frontend

**Recommended stack:** Node.js (Express, Fastify), Go, or Rust (choose what you’re comfortable with).

**Key endpoints:**
- `/login` — Initiates OAuth with your PDS
- `/callback` — Handles OAuth callback, stores session
- `/api/xrpc-proxy/*` — Proxies all XRPC calls to your PDS, manages session refresh/activity

---

## **Step 2: Implement Extended Session Storage**

**Goal:** Store ATProto session tokens and track activity/expiry.

**How:**
- Use a database or Redis to store sessions:
  ```js
  {
    sessionId: "...", // your own session id (JWT or random)
    atprotoSession: { ... }, // the session object from PDS
    createdAt: Date,
    lastActivity: Date,
    expiresAt: Date, // 2 years from creation
    activityWindow: Date // 3 months from last activity
  }
  ```
- On every proxied request, update `lastActivity` and extend `activityWindow`.

---

## **Step 3: OAuth Flow with Your PDS**

**Goal:** Authenticate users via your PDS and store their session in your proxy.

**How:**
- On `/login`, redirect to your PDS’s OAuth endpoint (e.g. `/xrpc/com.atproto.server.createSession` or the OAuth endpoint you’ve configured).
- On `/callback`, receive the OAuth code, exchange it for a session with your PDS, and store it in your session store.
- Issue your own session cookie/JWT to the frontend.

---

## **Step 4: Proxy XRPC Calls and Enforce Session Policy**

**Goal:** All frontend XRPC calls go through your proxy, which:
- Validates your own session token
- Checks/refreshes the ATProto session with your PDS if needed
- Updates activity timestamps
- Proxies the call to `/xrpc/` on your PDS

**How:**
- Middleware checks if session is expired (2 years) or inactive (3 months)
- If valid, attaches the ATProto session token and proxies the request
- If not, returns 401 and prompts re-login

---

## **Step 5: Refresh ATProto Session as Needed**

**Goal:** If the ATProto session is about to expire, use the refresh token (if available) to get a new session from your PDS and update your store.

---

## **Step 6: Update Your Frontend**

**Goal:** Make all ATProto API calls via your proxy, not directly to the PDS.

**How:**
- Change your API base URL to your proxy (e.g. `https://your-bff-server/api/xrpc-proxy`)
- On login, use your proxy’s `/login` and `/callback` endpoints

---

## **Step 7: Security and Cleanup**

- Secure your proxy endpoints (HTTPS, CORS, CSRF, etc.)
- Periodically clean up expired/inactive sessions from your store
- Optionally, implement monitoring/logging for session activity

---

## **Step 8: (Optional) DPoP/Advanced Security**

- If you want to use DPoP, generate and store DPoP keys server-side and sign requests as needed (see [AIP BFF example](https://github.com/graze-social/aip/tree/ngerakines/aip-rs/examples/react-website)).

---

## **Example Session Middleware (Node.js/Express Pseudocode)**

```js
app.use('/api/xrpc-proxy/*', async (req, res, next) => {
  const sessionId = req.cookies.sessionId || req.headers['x-session-id'];
  const session = await db.getSession(sessionId);

  if (!session || Date.now() > session.expiresAt || Date.now() > session.activityWindow) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Session expired' });
  }

  // Update activity
  session.lastActivity = Date.now();
  session.activityWindow = Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 90; // 3 months
  await db.saveSession(session);

  // Proxy the request to your PDS
  const pdsResponse = await proxyToPDS(req, session.atprotoSession);
  res.json(pdsResponse);
});
```
